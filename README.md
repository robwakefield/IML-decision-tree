Based on WIFI signal strengths collected from a mobile phone, a decision tree algorithm was implemented to determine its indoor location.

## Usage

Option 1: Default datasets ("WIFI db/clean dataset.txt" and "WIFI db/noisy dataset.txt")

Run **python decision_tree.py**


Option 2: New dataset

Run **python decision_tree.py _<path to dataset>_ **
