# Decision Tree

Implementation of a decision tree algorithm to determine an indoor location based on WIFI signal strengths collected by a mobile phone  

Completed as part of a group coursework

## Usage

Run **python decision_tree.py \<**_path to dataset_**>**

This will create a decision tree for the given dataset.

The program will output 2 versions of the decision tree:
1. output/dataset_tree.png: A symmetrical binary tree image.
2. output/dataset_tree_alternative.png: An asymmetrical tree that may display better for high depth trees.
