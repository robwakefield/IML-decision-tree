# Introduction to Machine Learning - Decision Tree Coursework

Based on WIFI signal strengths collected from a mobile phone, a decision tree algorithm was implemented to determine its indoor location.

## Usage

- Option 1: Default datasets ("_WIFI_db/clean dataset.txt_" and "_WIFI_db/noisy dataset.txt_")

    Run **python decision_tree.py**


- Option 2: New dataset

    Run **python decision_tree.py \<**_path to dataset_**>**
